    about: `Ōkami is an action-adventure video game developed by Clover
    Studio and published by Capcom. It was released for
    PlayStation 2 in 2006 in Japan and North America, and in
    2007 in Europe and Australia. After the closure of Clover
    Studio a few months after the release, a port for Wii was
    developed by Ready at Dawn, Tose, and Capcom, and released
    in 2008. Set in classical Japan, Ōkami combines Japanese
    mythology and folklore to tell the story of how the land was
    saved from darkness by the Shinto sun goddess, named
    Amaterasu, who took the form of a white wolf. It features a
    sumi-e-inspired cel-shaded visual style and the Celestial
    Brush, a gesture-system to perform miracles. The game was
    planned to use more traditional realistic rendering, but
    this had put a strain on the graphics processing of the
    PlayStation 2. Clover Studio switched to a cel-shaded style
    to reduce the processing, which led to the Celestial Brush
    concept. The gameplay is modeled on The Legend of Zelda, one
    of director Hideki Kamiya's favorite series.`,

    Kondo and Shinobu Tanaka. The game takes place on the

    Peach and five Toads are taking a vacation. A villain
    resembling Mario, known as Shadow Mario, vandalizes the
    island with graffiti and leaves Mario to be wrongfully
    convicted for the mess. Mario is ordered to clean up Isle
    Delfino, using a device called the Flash Liquidizer Ultra

    title: 'Portal',
    squareImage: PortalImage,
    about: `Portal is a 2007 puzzle-platform game developed and
    published by Valve. It was released in a bundle, The Orange
    Box, for Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and has been
    since ported to other systems, including Mac OS X, Linux,
    and Android (via Nvidia Shield). Portal consists primarily
    of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting
    the player's character and simple objects using "the
    Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device", a device that can
    create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The
    player-character, Chell, is challenged and taunted by an
    artificial intelligence named GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and
    Disk Operating System) to complete each puzzle in the
    Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with
    the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are
    completed. The game's unique physics allows kinetic energy
    to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of
    portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay
    element is based on a similar concept from the game
    Narbacular Drop; many of the team members from the DigiPen
    Institute of Technology who worked on Narbacular Drop were
    hired by Valve for the creation of Portal, making it a
    spiritual successor to the game.`,

    are judged by how well they time their dance to the patterns
    presented to them and are allowed to choose more music to
    play to if they receive a passing score.`,

    collecting multipurpose items to aid in objectives or
    solving puzzles and side quests for rewards. The world is
    unstructured and designed to reward experimentation, and the
    story can be completed in a nonlinear fashion.`,

    about: `Metroid Prime is an action-adventure game developed by Retro
    Studios and Nintendo for the GameCube. Metroid Prime is the
    fifth main installment in the Metroid series, and the first
    Metroid game to use 3D computer graphics being played from
    the first-person perspective. Because exploration takes
    precedence over combat, Nintendo classifies the game as a
    first-person adventure rather than a first-person shooter.
    It was released in North America in November 2002, and in
    Japan and Europe the following year. On the same day as its
    North American release, Nintendo also released the Game Boy
    Advance game Metroid Fusion, marking the return of the
    Metroid series after an eight-year hiatus following Super
    Metroid (1994). Metroid Prime is the first of the three-part
    Prime storyline, which takes place between the original
    Metroid and Metroid II: Return of Samus. Like previous games
    in the series, Metroid Prime has a science fiction setting
    in which players control the bounty hunter Samus Aran. The
    story follows Samus as she battles the Space Pirates and
    their biological experiments on the planet Tallon IV. The
    game was a collaboration between Retro's staff in Austin,
    Texas, and Japanese Nintendo employees, including producer
    Shigeru Miyamoto, who suggested the project after visiting
    Retro's headquarters in 2000.`,

    about: `Super Mario World is a 1990 platform game developed by
    Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The
    story follows Mario's quest to save Princess Toadstool and
    Dinosaur Land from the series antagonist Bowser and his
    minions, the Koopalings. The gameplay is similar to that of
    earlier Super Mario games: Players control Mario or his
    brother Luigi through a series of levels in which the goal
    is to reach the flagpole at the end. Super Mario World
    introduced Yoshi, a dinosaur who can eat enemies, as well as
    gain abilities by eating the shells of Koopa Troopas.
    Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development developed the
    game, led by director Takashi Tezuka and producer and series
    creator Shigeru Miyamoto. It is the first Mario game for the
    SNES and was designed to make the most of the console's
    technical features. The development team had more freedom
    compared to the series installments for the Nintendo
    Entertainment System (NES). Yoshi was conceptualised during
    the development of the NES games but was not used until
    Super Mario World due to hardware limitations. Super Mario
    World is often considered one of the greatest video games of
    all time.`,

    players to save their progress at will with limited
    resources, and an upgrade system that gives players the
    ability to strengthen Ori's skills and abilities.`,
