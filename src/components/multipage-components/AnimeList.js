    about: `Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric are raised by their
    mother Trisha Elric in the remote village of Resembool in
    the country of Amestris. Their father Hohenheim, a noted and
    very gifted alchemist, abandoned his family while the boys
    were still young, and while in Trisha's care they began to
    show an affinity for alchemy and became curious about its
    secrets. However, when Trisha died of a lingering illness,
    they were cared for by their best friend Winry Rockbell and
    her grandmother Pinako. The boys traveled the world to
    advance their alchemic training under Izumi Curtis. Upon
    returning home, the two decide to try to bring their mother
    back to life with alchemy. However, human transmutation is a
    taboo, as it is impossible to do so properly. In the failed
    transmutation that results, Al's body is completely
    obliterated, and Ed loses his left leg. In a last ditch
    attempt to keep his brother alive, Ed sacrifices his right
    arm to bring Al's soul back and houses it in a nearby suit
    of armor. After Edward receives automail prosthetics from
    Winry and Pinako, the brothers decide to burn their
    childhood home down (symbolizing their determination and
    decision of "no turning back") and head to the capital city
    to become government sanctioned State Alchemists. After
    passing the exam, Edward is dubbed the "Fullmetal Alchemist"
    by the State Military, and the brothers begin their quest to
    regain their full bodies back through the fabled
    Philosopher's Stone, under the direction of Colonel Roy
    Mustang. Along the way, they discover a deep government
    conspiracy to hide the true nature of the Philosopher's
    Stone that involves the homunculi, the alchemists of the
    neighboring nation of Xing, the scarred man from the
    war-torn nation of Ishval, and their own father's past.`,

    about: `An orphaned girl named Riko lives in the Belchero Orphanage
    in the town of Orth. The town surrounds a strange, giant
    hole going deep into the earth, which is commonly called the
    Abyss. The Abyss harbors artifacts and remnants of a
    civilization long gone, and is therefore the popular hunting
    spot for so-called Cave Raiders, who undertake arduous and
    dangerous descents into the mist-filled pit to recover
    whatever relics they can find. Returning from the Abyss can
    be dangerous as "the Curse of the Abyss," a mysterious and
    potentially fatal malady, manifests upon ascension. The
    deeper one goes, the more acute the effects of the curse;
    few who have descended into the lower regions have returned
    to tell of their experiences. Some legendary Cave Raiders
    earn the title of White Whistle, one of them being Riko's
    mother, Lyza. Riko's longing in life is to follow in her
    mother's footsteps and become a White Whistle.[4] One day
    she discovers a robot resembling a human boy in the Abyss
    and names him Reg. Riko and her friends sneak Reg into
    Belchero and quickly welcome him into their close-knit
    group. Some time later, a balloon reaches the surface from
    the depths of the Abyss containing pages of discoveries made
    by Lyza, as well as a message for Riko stating she is
    waiting at the bottom of the Abyss. Riko, determined to find
    her mother, bids farewell to her friends and departs to the
    Abyss with Reg as her companion.`,
